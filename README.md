# ANOTHER ODIN PROJECT PROJECT

# "TIC-TAC-TOE"

# OR AS I KNOW IT "NOUGHTS AND CROSSES"

### project begun 23-Aug-2021

The most ambitious project yet, and one that is quite a way ahead of my current knowledge and capability.

For this project, I must use objects and Constructors to build and control the game. AI opponen is optional, but if I'm diving into objects and Constructors (and it seems that I am), I might as well go the whole hog.

Before I do anything, a proper refresher on objects and Constructors is required.
