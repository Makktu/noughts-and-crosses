# ANOTHER ODIN PROJECT PROJECT

## "TIC-TAC-TOE"

## OR AS I KNOW IT "NOUGHTS AND CROSSES"

### project begun 23-Aug-2021

The most ambitious project yet, and one that is quite a way ahead of my current knowledge and capability.

For this project, I must use objects and Constructors to build and control the game. Coding an AI opponent is optional. The aim is to build the machinery of the game and the method if interfacing with the gameboard. But if I'm diving into objects and Constructors (and it seems that I am), I might as well go the whole hog and create the AI, too.

This will be a long project. Weeks not days. Hopefully not months.

Before I do anything, a proper refresher on objects and Constructors is required.
